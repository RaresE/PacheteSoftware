# 🍷 Wine Quality Analysis App

**Team Project**

The Wine Quality Analysis App is a **Streamlit web application** designed for data science and wine enthusiasts who want to explore, visualize, and predict wine quality with ease. Using a clean, interactive interface, users can dive into the chemistry of red wines, detect trends, spot outliers, and even test machine learning models.

This project is developed in **Python** using **Streamlit** as the front-end and integrates powerful libraries like **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, and **Seaborn** for insights and prediction.

## ✨ Main Features

📂 **View Wine Dataset** – Explore the chemical properties and quality ratings of red wine samples.

📊 **Interactive Visualizations** – Generate histograms, pie charts, boxplots, pairplots, and heatmaps to better understand data patterns.

🔍 **Outlier Detection** – Detect outliers using IQR with visual feedback and threshold details.

🧪 **Log & Normalize Data** – Apply log transformations, standardization, and normalization to prepare data for modeling.

🧠 **Machine Learning Models** – Predict wine quality categories (`low`, `medium`, `high`) using:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

📈 **Model Evaluation** – View classification reports, confusion matrices, and performance metrics in real-time.

💡 **Feature Correlation Analysis** – Analyze relationships between variables using a dynamic correlation matrix.

📥 **Label Encoding** – Automatically convert wine quality categories into numerical labels for modeling.

📋 **Data Summary & Description** – Get full context on dataset variables and background on the wine quality scoring system.
